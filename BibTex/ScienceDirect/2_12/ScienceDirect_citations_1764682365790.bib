abstract = {This work proposes a communication system based on G3-PLC (G3 - Power Line Communication) technology and a Morphological Filter (MF) for the transmission of analogue Generic Reference Waveforms (GRW) in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications (e.g., power control of wind turbines). The presented proposal allows to reduce the system latency without compromising the integrity of the GRW, even in very severe operating conditions, through the use of a MF and the deactivation of the G3-PLC retransmission protocol. Computer simulations were performed considering a very accurate and representative model of the physical layer of the G3-PLC and the communication channel and the results obtained demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed system in recovering the transmitted GRW without the need for retransmissions, reducing considerably the system latency, and making possible real-time M2M communications.}
