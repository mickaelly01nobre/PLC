abstract = {This paper advances the investigation of the adequacy of inductive coupling-based narrowband power line communication (PLC) systems in overhead medium voltage power distribution networks (MV-PDNs). Relying on raw data obtained from a measurement campaign which was carried out in urban and rural feeders in the south region of Brazil, it shows that overhead MV-PDNs may be a challenging data communication media when considering inductive coupling devices since the level of insertion losses associated with the coupling process is relevant. Also, the presence of significant loads between the source and destination nodes can severely degrade loops of currents, which are necessary to perform data communication in an inductive coupling-base PLC system, resulting in an erasure data communication media. For the reliable links (i.e., without erasure), the performance analysis shows that PLC channel impulse responses and additive noises can be respectively modeled as time-invariant systems with a quasi-flat channel frequency magnitude and white Gaussian random processes in urban and rural areas. Last but not least, an attenuation model and achievable data rates are discussed for the reliable links.}
