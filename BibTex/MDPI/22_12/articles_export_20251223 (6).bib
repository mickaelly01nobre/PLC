ABSTRACT = {The aim of this paper is to formulate the physical layer of the broadband and narrowband power line communication (PLC) systems described in standards IEEE 1901 and IEEE 1901.2, which address new communication technologies over electrical networks for Smart Grid and Internet of Things applications. Specifically, this paper presents a mathematical formulation by means of matrices of a transmitter and receiver system based on windowed OFDM. The proposed formulation is essential for obtaining the input–output relation, as well as an analysis of the interference present in the system. It is very useful for simulating PLC systems using software designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays, such as Matlab. In addition, it eases the analysis and design of different receiver configurations, simply by modifying or adding a matrix. Since the relevant standards only describe the blocks corresponding to the transmitter, and leave the set-up of the receiver open to the manufacturer, we analysed four different possible schemes that include window functions in different configurations. In simulations, the behaviour of each of these schemes is analysed in terms of bit error and achievable data rates using artificial and real noises.},
