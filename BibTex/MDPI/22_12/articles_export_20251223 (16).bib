ABSTRACT = {Every year the number of IoT devices is growing, which gives a boost to development of such technology as Power Line Communication (PLC). The term PLC refers to the use of a power supply circuit to transmit data. Full-duplex technology can be applied to increase the data transfer rate in a PLC. The difficulty in using a full duplex is the need to suppress the transmitter’s own signal (interference signal). Analog cancellation and digital cancellation are used for this purpose. Common algorithms for digital cancellation are adaptive algorithms. In this paper adaptive algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) are considered and a modification of the classical RLS is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses precalculated weight coefficients together with periodic reinitialization of the filter. This avoids the influence of significant changes in the input signal on the further process of filter adaptation and provides the highest level of echo suppression. The proposed algorithm provides an improvement of parameters such as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) in comparison with classical RLS and PSO, according to the results of the study.},
