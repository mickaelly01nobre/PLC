ABSTRACT = {Broadband power line communication (PLC) is used as a communication technique for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in Korea. High-speed (HS) PLC specified in ISO/IEC12139-1 and HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) are deployed for remote metering. Recently, internet of things (IoT) PLC has been proposed for reliable communications on harsh power line channels. In this paper, the physical layer performance of IoT PLC, HPGP, and HS PLC is evaluated and compared. Three aspects of the performance are evaluated: the bit rate, power spectrum, and bit error rate (BER). An expression for the bit rate for IoT PLC and HPGP is derived while taking the padding bits and number of tones in use into consideration. The power spectrum is obtained through computer simulations. For the BER performance comparisons, the upper bound of the BER for each PLC standard is evaluated through computer simulations.},
