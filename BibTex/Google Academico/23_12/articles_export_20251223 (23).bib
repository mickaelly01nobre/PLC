ABSTRACT = {Power-line communication (PLC) networks have been increasingly used for constructing industrial IoT (internet of things) and home networking systems due to their low-cost installation and broad coverage feature. To guarantee the transmission reliability, ARQ (automatic repeat request) scheme is introduced into the link layer of reliable PLC networks, which allows the retransmission of a data frame several times so that it has a higher probability to be correctly received. However, current studies of performance analysis for PLC MAC (medium access control) protocol (i.e., IEEE 1901) do not take into account of the impact of ARQ scheme. To resolve this problem, we propose an analytical model to investigate the MAC performance of IEEE 1901 protocol for reliable PLC networks with ARQ scheme. In the modeling process, we first establish a PLC channel model to reflect the impacts of PLC channel types (containing Rayleigh fading and Log-normal fading), additive non-Gaussian noise feature and ARQ scheme on data transmission at link layer. Next, we employ Renewal theory and Queueing dynamics to capture the transmission attempt behavior of executing IEEE 1901 protocol in the unsaturated environment with finite transit buffer size. On the basis of combining these two models, we derive the closed-form expressions of 1901 MAC metrics considering the influence of the ARQ scheme. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed analytical model has the convergence property. Finally, we evaluate the MAC performance of 1901 protocol for reliable PLC networks with ARQ scheme and verify the proposed analytical model.},
