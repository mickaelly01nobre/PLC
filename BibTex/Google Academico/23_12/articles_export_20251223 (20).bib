ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a dual-purpose LED driver system that functions as both a lighting source and a Visible Light Communication (VLC) transmitter integrated with a Powerline Communication (PLC) network under the PRIME G3 standard. The system decodes PLC messages from the powerline grid and transmits the information via LED light to an optical receiver under a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. The load design targets a light flux of 800 lumens, suitable for LED light bulb applications up to 10 watts, ensuring practicality and energy efficiency. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) module enables communication between the PLC and VLC systems, allowing for an LED driver with dynamic control and real-time operation. Key signal processing stages are commented and developed, including a hybrid buck converter with modulation capabilities and a nonlinear optical receiver to regenerate the BPSK reference signal for VLC. Results show a successful prototype working under a laboratory environment. Experimental validation shows successful transmission of bit streams from the PLC grid to the VLC setup. A design guideline is presented in order to dictate the design of the electronic devices involved in the experiment. Finally, this research highlights the feasibility of integrating PLC and VLC technologies, offering an efficient and cost-effective solution for data transmission over existing infrastructure.},
