abstract = {Abstract After more than two decades since intensive research began on power line communications (PLC) technology, this interesting field of telecommunication engineering is still progressing towards maturity. Despite some factors that delay its worldwide acceptance, its implementation is starting to take off. Research in PLC is motivated (i) by many factors such as the crowded radio frequency spectrum that requires to be sustained by alternative technologies and (ii) by the emanation of other new technologies that may help PLC to extend its practical implementation such as visible light communications or other wireless communication technologies like near-field communications. PLC technology is used in applications requiring both low and high data rate but traditionally exploited in applications in which the node does not move. Nowadays, PLC has become widely accepted; hence, a review of the technology may be useful to keep the readers aware of new updates. In this paper, we provide an overview of the evolution of PLC technology over the last few decades.},
