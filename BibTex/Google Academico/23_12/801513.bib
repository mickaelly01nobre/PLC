In order to provide them, SGs need to be fully realized by integrating communication technologies infrastructures. Today, SGs have some main systems. These are Advanced Meter Reading (AMR), distributed renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicle and smart city-home implementations. AMR is the most prominent SG component between all SG main systems. Because it provides to follow all consumers remotely and momentarily using their Smart Meters (SM). AMR system is based on SM, gateway, meter data management software and wired or wireless communication method. Nowadays, Power Line Communication (PLC) is the most popular wired communication method for remote meter reading because of try to use existing electric distribution grid infrastructure. On the other hand, GPRS/EDGE/3G is one of the widespread wireless communication method for remote meter reading implementations but its costly and external dependence has started the search for new communication methods instead. In this paper, practically twelve electric meters are tried to be read remotely with PLC in Yeşilırmak Electric Distribution Company field until the distribution transformer. These remote meter reading results that captured with PLC will evaluate in AMR software. Then an AMR system model is put forward thanks to this field implementation. Beside this a hybrid communication method has been suggested for smart metering. PLC key parameters will find out. In addition, data concentrator (DC), meter and gateway that has PLC features equipment field configurations will research.}, number={1}, publisher={İlker ÖRS}, organization={ICAT 20}
