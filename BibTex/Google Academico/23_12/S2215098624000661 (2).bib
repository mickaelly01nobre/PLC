abstract = {Power Line Communication (PLC) is an emerging technology that utilizes existing electrical power infrastructure for data transmission. It enables communication over power lines, allowing devices to exchange information and access the internet through the power grid. This method offers numerous advantages, including widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and easy deployment without the need for additional cabling. PLC has found applications in various domains, including smart grid management, home automation, industrial control systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. This abstract provides an overview of PLC, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and key technologies. It also discusses the potential of PLC in transforming power distribution networks into intelligent and interconnected systems. Additionally, emerging trends and future directions for PLC research and development are explored, emphasizing the potential for enhanced reliability, speed, and efficiency in data transmission over power lines. This paper proposed a two way communication from source to load sides using BPSK and QPSK modulation techniques. Monte Carlo simulation is used to predict the transformer theoretical channel (AWGN) and compare the efficiency of the proposed methods. Randomly selected data from 10 k to 50 k size are used to compare the performance curve. Moreover, a test sound data is sent from the source side to the load side and it is observed that using the QPSK modulation technique has almost zero Bit Error Rate (BER).}
