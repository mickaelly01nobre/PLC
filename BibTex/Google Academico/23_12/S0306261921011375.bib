abstract = {Electrical energy consumption data accessibility for low voltage end users is one of the pillars of smart grids. In some countries, despite the presence of smart meters, a fragmentary data availability and/or the lack of standardization hinders the creation of post-metering value-added services and confines such innovative solutions to the prototypal and experimental level. We take inspiration from the technology adopted in Italy, where the national regulatory authority actively supported the definition of a solution agreed upon by all the involved stakeholders. In this context, smart meters are enabled to convey data to low voltage end users through a power line communication channel (CHAIN 2) in near real-time. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it describes the proof of concept that the channel underwent and its subsequent validation (with performances nearing 99% success rate). On the other hand, it defines a classification framework (I2MA) for post-metering value-added services, in order to categorize each use case based on both level of service and expected benefits, and understand its maturity level. As an example, we apply the methodology to the 16 use cases defined in Italy. The lessons learned from the regulatory, technological, and functional approach of the Italian experience bring us to the provision of recommendations for researchers and industry experts. In particular, we argue that a well-functioning post-metering value-added services’ market can flourish when: (i) distribution system operators certify the measurements coming from smart meters; (ii) national regulatory authorities support the technological innovation needed for setting up this market; and (iii) service providers create customer-oriented solutions based on smart meters’ data.}
