abstract = {In this paper, the channel model of a multicarrier, indoor amplify-and-forward (AF) hybrid power-line communication (PLC) and visible light communication (VLC) channel is demonstrated. Measurements are obtained from different positions between the VLC transmitter and receiver in an indoor testbed with the aid of software-defined radios. Using the obtained measurements, channel models are derived using a semi-hidden Markov model (SHMM) with the aid of a Fritchman channel state representation model. The Baum-Welch algorithm is then used to re-estimate and validate the derived models. Results presented show the error-free run distribution in the hybrid channel and the probability of error from the obtained measurements. The re-estimated probability of error (P¯e) of each measured indoor scenario is also seen to match the corresponding measured Pe, showing the validity of the derived SHMM models.}
