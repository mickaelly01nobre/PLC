abstract = {The Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is commonly used for electromechanical process automation. A home automation system is being developed using PLC. The proposed control module will consist of Model Functional Blocks device emulation. Upgrading human standards of living is the most important source of inspiration for the continuation of technological advances. Technology innovation directly and indirectly offers and enhances the protection and comfort of human beings. The advancement of technology for this reason directly affects the quality of living through the design of smart home systems. Smart home systems can be classified as local and remote in two ways. In this research, a smart home automation system design was carried out by using Delta PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The control module provides fault detection, tolerance and switching on or off in sensitive areas for multiple components. Combining the PLC model with other devices, such as GSM is also possible. By supplying voice control and protection products, such a form of application would be highly helpful for the elderly and disabled persons. World is developing increasingly across the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we are designing a system that will track home appliances automatically and generate email or messanger notifications or make smart decisions using the IoT model. The key contribution of this paper is that it summarizes the use of IoT to track and regulate the market in industries with artificial intelligence. By optimizing the entire hardware assembly and software algorithms, the Delta PLC device is adjustable to satisfy demands, incorporating distinct home appliances in a short time. The PLC is simple to understand, and by using a single model, the system offers several solutions. The PLC will become the epic center for many new applications, as it is new but more powerful than previous systems.}
