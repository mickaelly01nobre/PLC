    abstract = { The role of power line communication (PLC) in smart grids becomes more significant as the understanding of the channel improves. Since PLC reduces the additional infrastructure required to link regular devices onto the network, devices can hence be more easily linked to the Internet of Things (IoT) network to create smart buildings, vehicles and grids. The challenge with the harsh PLC channel has been how to mitigate noise in the channel, which is commonly man-made, hence difficult to predict. In this chapter, we evaluate the different indoor PLC channel models and discuss the memoryless channel and the channel with memory. The statistical representations that best describe the channel models are derived which can be used for offline analysis as well as inform appropriate modulation and coding techniques for error mitigation in the channel. }
