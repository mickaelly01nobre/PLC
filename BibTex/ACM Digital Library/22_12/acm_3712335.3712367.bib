abstract = {The research on the characteristics of power line carrier communication channel and the establishment of the model are the theoretical basis for the realization of high-speed data transmission on power line. Firstly, the fading, impedance and noise characteristics of power line channel are analyzed; Then the top-down and bottom-up power line channel modeling methods are described and compared; Finally, several factors causing power line channel attenuation are simulated and analyzed to establish the power line carrier communication channel model under complex conditions such as interference and noise.},
