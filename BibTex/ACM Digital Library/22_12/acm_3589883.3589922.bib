abstract = {This paper introduces an end-to-end trainable power line communication (PLC) system based on a deep neural network (DNN). PLC channels are challenging to be modeled and estimated because of uncertain loads in utility / power grids, heterogeneous network topologies, and many equipment such as switching gears, relays, transformers, etc., which are usually not considered in traditional communication systems. With a trainable transmitter and receiver, this paper designs a PLC system not requiring any power line channel information. The designed PLC system can achieve similar bit error rate (BER) performances to the cases harnessing perfect power line channel information. Since the proposed design can be end-to-end trained without any PLC channel information in diverse power line environments, it will be a promising PLC communication design even for internet of things (IoT) applications targeting for smart grids, smart homes / factories etc.},
