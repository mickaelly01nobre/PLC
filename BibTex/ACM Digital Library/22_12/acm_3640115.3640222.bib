abstract = {With the increasing pressure of global resources, environment and population, the deepening of power system reform, and the continuous improvement of users' requirements for reliability and power quality of power supply system, safe, reliable, efficient and interactive power grid is the further development direction of power industry in the future. Combined with the Internet of Things technology, this paper analyzes the power line carrier communication technology of distribution network automation, and uses intelligent system to output data in real time. Moreover, based on the extensive interconnection and comprehensive state perception of distribution Internet of Things devices, this paper uses the full exchange collection between intelligent fusion terminals and HPLC smart meters to deeply mine smart meter data. In the architecture of distribution Internet of Things, this paper proposes to adopt MQTT protocol between distribution master station and distribution terminal, and CoAP protocol between distribution terminal and terminal equipment. Under special configuration conditions, distribution master station can directly exchange information with terminal equipment. The test results show that it is feasible and effective.},
