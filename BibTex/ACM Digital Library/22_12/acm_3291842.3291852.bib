abstract = {In the field of smart home, power line communication has been used widely with the advantage of its long-distance and low-cost. In this paper, we propose an intelligent home system design based on power line communication.This system is built with PLC module, singlechip, intelligent electric meter and relay module. And A PC client and server program is designed to implement remote meter reading and appliance control using power line carrier communication.},
