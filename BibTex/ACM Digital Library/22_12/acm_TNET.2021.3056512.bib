abstract = {As powerline communication (PLC) technology does not require dedicated cabling and network setup, it can be used to easily connect multitude of IoT devices deployed in enterprise environments for sensing and control related applications. IEEE has standardized the PLC protocol in IEEE 1901, also known as HomePlug AV (HPAV) which has been widely adopted in mainstream PLC devices. A key weakness of HPAV protocol is that it does not support spectrum sharing. Currently, each link in an HPAV PLC network operates over the whole available spectrum, and only one link can operate at any time within a single collision domain. In this work, through an extensive measurement study of HPAV PLCs in a real enterprise environment using commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) HPAV PLC devices, we discover that spectrum sharing can significantly benefit enterprise level PLC networks. To this end, we propose a distributed spectrum sharing technique for enterprise HPAV PLC networks, and show that fine-grained distributed spectrum sharing on top of current HPAV MAC protocols can significantly boost the aggregated and per-link throughput, by allowing multiple PLC links to communicate concurrently, while requiring only a few modifications to the existing HPAV devices and protocols.},
