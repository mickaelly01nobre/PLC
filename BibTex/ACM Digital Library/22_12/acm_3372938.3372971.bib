abstract = {Power line communications (PLC) network is one of the promising communication technologies for data transmission and information exchange in indoor distribution networks, because it does not require any new wiring installations, which can significantly reduce the deployment costs. This network is a practical solution for connecting all computer and multimedia devices to each other and to the telecommunication network, but there are still several problematic areas in data transmission over power lines cables. The power line channel is harsh environments for signal transmission. Indeed, many factors influence the communication path and path losses. These factors include the cable type, loading conditions, impedances, the types of devices or appliances connected to them. In this work, we focus on investigating these factors via simulations results of the transfer function of the indoor PLC channel. In addition we study the effect of line, branched line length, the number of branched, and impedance of devices connected to the PLC network on the performance of PLC Technology.},
